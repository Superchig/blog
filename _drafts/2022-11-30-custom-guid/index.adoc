= Custom GUIDs in Unity
:toc:

// Interestingly, someone at Unity already has a GUID component setup, though I
// didn't learn about it until recently:
// https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/guid-based-reference
// Also, this approach doesn't have a manager, though I'm not sure if this
// actually needs to use this manager?

== Introduction

If you've ever tried to save data for a large number of entities in a
video game, you've probably come across an approach that looks like this:

1. Associate each entity with a persistent, unique ID.
2. Create a key-value store (like a Python dictionary), using these IDs as keys
and records with the relevant data for each entity as values.
3. Write the key-value store to disk / read the key-value store from disk as
necessary.

It's possible to go into significantly more detail for each of these steps, but
this article will focus primarily on the first one: assigning persistent, unique
IDs.

== The Problem

Specifically, this article will explain how to create a MonoBehaviour script
which, when attached to a GameObject, will assign it a unique ID that persists
between different play sessions.

With a script like this, you would want these IDs to be unique even in the
following situations:

1. A developer duplicates a GameObject (in the editor).
2. A developer converts a GameObject into a prefab (in the editor).
3. A developer instantiates a prefab (in the editor).

If a normal MonoBehaviour script were attached to the GameObject in any of these
cases, then the fields on that script would be duplicated along with the
GameObject.

You would have GameObjects with the same IDs as their prefabs, or duplicate
GameObjects with identical IDs. This would make it impossible to save/load data
for individual GameObjects.

== GUIDs

First of all, let's settle what a GUID is. In short, a GUID (also known as a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier[UUID]) is a 128-bit
data structure that represents a globally unique ID.

As the name of this article implies, we'll be using GUIDs as our IDs in this
article.

Specifically, we'll be (automatically) creating these GUIDs in the editor, so
that the specific GUID value for each GameObject is part of its scene. This will
keep these GUIDs the same every time the player plays the game.

Unity already uses GUIDs to refer to different assets in the editor (and you can
actually see them in use if you look into the .meta or .asset files in a Unity
project).

It's worth nothing that Unity already creates unique IDs to refer to each
GameObject. However, these IDs will change between
https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.GetInstanceID.html[player
runtime and Editor sessions], making them useless for the purposes of
saving/loading data.

// FIXME(Chris): Mention that we'll be using the C# standard library's GUID
// type, which comes with an easy method to generate new IDs

== The ExecuteAlways attribute

In Unity, our C# scripts typically run during a player's runtime session.
That is, they execute code either when we play the game in the editor or when
the player is running an actual build.

Since we're creating GUIDs in the editor, we'll need to execute some code in the
editor itself. To achieve this, we'll use
https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ExecuteAlways.html[the `ExecuteAlways`
attribute].

It's worth noting that there is an
https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/ExecuteInEditMode.html[older
and similar attribute called `ExecuteInEditMode`], which has been deprecated.
Annoyingly, this deprecation warning only shows up in the middle of its
documentation (at least for Unity version 2021.3).

The ExecuteAlways attribute is fairly straightforward. This example is taken
from Unity's documentation for the attribute:

[source,csharp]
----
using UnityEngine;

[ExecuteAlways]
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        if (Application.IsPlaying(gameObject))
        {
            // Play logic
        }
        else
        {
            // Editor logic
        }
    }
}
