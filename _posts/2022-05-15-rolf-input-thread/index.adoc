= Rolf: User Input, Threads, and Channels

:fn-large: footnote:[Rolf doesn't necessarily load insanely large images, but there can be a noticeable loading time. Going forward, we might want to use a https://lib.rs/crates/mozjpeg[faster JPEG decoder].]

Assume that you’re writing a TUI application (like
https://github.com/Superchig/rolf[`rolf`]) which does at least two
things:

1. Respond to user input, and
2. Load in incredibly large{fn-large} images.

If you’re working on a program like this, you might run into an annoying
problem: users have to wait for images to load before they can do
anything.

The solution to this problem is to asynchronously obtain user input.

Depending on your runtime (e.g.
https://thecodest.co/blog/asynchronous-and-single-threaded-javascript-meet-the-event-loop/[nodejs]),
it’s possible to be both asynchronous and single-threaded.

However, for the purposes of `rolf`, we used multiple threads to handle
asynchronous input.

== Architecture

For the purposes of this post, let's say that there are 3 threads
involvedfootnote:[`rolf` actually uses more threads than the ones shown here,
but they're not relevant to this post.].

As seen in the diagram above, have a thread for:

- Receiving user input,
- Decoding images
- And everything else (the Main thread)

You might also notice that the Input and Image Decoding threads only interact
with the Main thread, sending data back and forth to each other.

The Input and Main threads will both run on "infinite" loops. The Input thread
will wait for user input, sending it to the Main thread as necessary, and the
Main thread will wait for either input data from the Input thread or decoded
image data from the Image Decoding thread, processing this data as necessary.

Notably, we achieve all of this without polling, instead using channels to send
between threads.

== Starting The Input Thread

We can start operating system threads with
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.spawn.html[`std::thread::spawn`],
conveniently provided by the Rust standard library.

Specifically, we'll start a thread whose sole purpose is to block on and
receive input data.

std::thread::spawn(move || {
    loop {
        let input_request_count = match from_main_rx.recv() {
            Ok(InputRequest::RequestNumber(input_request_count)) => input_request_count,
            Ok(InputRequest::Quit) => break,
            Err(err) => panic!("Input thread: Lost connnection to main thread: {:?}", err),
        };

        let crossterm_event = event::read().expect("Unable to read crossterm event");

        crossterm_input_tx
            .send(InputEvent::CrosstermEvent {
                event: crossterm_event,
                input_request_count,
            })
            .expect("Unable to send on channel");
    }
});

you just have general feedback? I’m still a Rust novice (arguably a
programming novice, in general), so feel free to email me at

please!
