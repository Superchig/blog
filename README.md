# Chris Chang's Blog

This uses Hugo to generate a static site.

This also includes a custom theme, `matklad-like`, which is heavily based on
the visual style of [matklad's blog](https://matklad.github.io/).

## TODO
- [ ] Clean up the visual presentation of the /posts/ link
- [ ] Correctly display dates in the /tags/ link
- [ ] Avoid double-displaying tagged posts when using the /tags/ link
